	  <p class="ultramajor">The MaVi Research Visits (MaVi-RV) program provides an opportunity for high calibre PGR students to spend 3 months at the University of Bristol collaborating with our MaVi researchers and faculty members. This document details the faculty open for visitors in the summer of 2026, eligibility and conditions for the scheme. </p>
        
<p class="ultramajor">Importantly, this program only provides registration fees and GPU access for candidates. Any travel, visa or accommodation fees should be provided by your own institution. Please check with your advisor before applying.  </p>
        
        <p class="ultramajor">There is a small number of partial funds (£3K) available for up to 5 accepted applications. If interested, please indicate that in your application form. Note that these funds might not cover the full cost of your flight and accommodation and you might need to secure additional funds from your institution</p>
        
<p class="ultramajor"> Applications are particularly encouraged from ELLIS PhD students who can use the ELLIS program funds to cover their travel and accommodation expenses. </p>
