Abstract: Research in artificial intelligence continues to advance quickly and outperforms humans in many tasks, making its way into our daily lives. However, beneath their superior performance, current technologies, limited in how to perceive, process, and understand our visual world, struggle with understanding and interacting with people. These issues raise the core question of my research: How do we build intelligent systems that can interact with people and offer assistance naturally and seamlessly? In this talk, I will present our works following the learn-to-predict paradigm through an egocentric perspective.
