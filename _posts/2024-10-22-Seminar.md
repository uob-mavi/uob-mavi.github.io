Abstract: In this talk, I will discuss recent publications from my group 
that attempt at learning models of the world and the effect of the actions 
of an agent within that world self-supervised, solely via interaction. 
In particular, I will discuss the potential and challenges of sequence 
generative models as a candidate for such a world model, the role of 
inductive biases using our recent work that discovers the kinematics of a 
robot as an example, and finally a new research direction in which we 
attempt to discover the physical rules underlying our world without any 
inductive biases whatsoever.
